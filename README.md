# Stock-Prediction
Here's a comprehensive summary of what I did with the Tesla stock price dataset, including the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling parts:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Loading:

I started by importing essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as Pandas and Matplotlib.
The Tesla stock price dataset was loaded from a CSV file, and the 'Date' column was converted to datetime format and set as the index.
Data Exploration:

I examined the first few rows of the dataset using data.head() to get an initial understanding of the data structure.
You printed the number of rows and columns in the dataset using data.shape.

Data Visualization:

I created various visualizations to explore the stock price data, including line plots to visualize the closing prices over time.
You used Matplotlib to generate these visualizations, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in the data.
I could have further expanded your EDA by exploring additional plots, such as moving averages or trading volume trends.

Modeling and Time Series Forecasting:

Data Preprocessing:

I performed Min-Max scaling on the closing prices to normalize the data, which is essential for neural network training.

Data Splitting:

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

Model Creation:

I constructed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for time series forecasting.
The model architecture included an LSTM layer with 50 units and a ReLU activation function, followed by a Dense layer with one unit.
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

Model Training:

The model was trained on the training data with target data that shifted prices by one step into the future.
The training process involved 100 epochs with a batch size of 1.

Model Prediction:

After training, the model made predictions on the test data.

Model Evaluation:

I calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the squared differences between actual and predicted prices.
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was also computed, providing a more interpretable measure of model performance.
The model's accuracy was determined as a percentage, reflecting its ability to predict stock prices compared to the actual data.

Visualization:

I created line plots to visualize both actual and predicted stock prices using Matplotlib, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.
In summary, I conducted a thorough EDA of the Tesla stock price dataset to understand its characteristics, trends, and patterns. Subsequently, you applied deep learning techniques, specifically an LSTM neural network, for time series forecasting. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and accuracy metrics. This combined EDA and modeling approach offers valuable insights for stock price prediction and can serve as a foundation for more advanced financial analyses.
